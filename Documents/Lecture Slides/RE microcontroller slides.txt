Dear Dr. Huang,
Last summer, I had requested your slides for the PIC microcontroller book, and 
you kindly sent me the slides for use in my class.
I was wondering if it will also be OK if I post the ppt (or pdf) version of 
the slides on a password protected web site accessible to students in  my 
class?
Thanks much
Kia
